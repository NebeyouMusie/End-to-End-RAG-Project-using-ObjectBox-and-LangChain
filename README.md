# End-to-End-RAG-Project-using-ObjectBox-and-LangChain
In this end to end project I have built a RAG app using ObjectBox Vector Databse and LangChain. RAG techniques allow us to augment a language model's knowledge base actively, ensuring your AI can access and reason with your data and the very latest information. With ObjectBox you can do that, without the data ever needing to leave the device.
